# üè† House Price Predictor

A Flask-based web application that predicts house prices based on input features using a trained machine learning model. The model is built using the **California Housing Dataset**, which includes information about house prices, income levels, and other housing-related features in California. This project demonstrates the integration of machine learning with Flask to create an interactive, user-friendly application.
